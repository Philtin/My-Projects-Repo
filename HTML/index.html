       <h1>My Technical Task NOW with StratusGrid</h1>
    This is a technical task, which is part of my interview with StratusGrid. It is the third stage of the interview process for the position of a Cloud Engineer with the company. 
       <h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
       The purpose of the project was to build all the necessary components for a CI/CD pipeline that can deploy and update a static site hosted on S3 as well as distribute that site to end users. One will need to make one's own Github for the site code and one's own AWS account for the resources.

       <h3>Specifications</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>A codified infrastructure using Terraform and provisioned in a way that can be redeployed to a different account with minor variable changes.</li>
         <li>S3 should be configured as a static site and used to host the content. </li>
         <li>Amazon CloudFront should be configured to distribute the content from the S3 static site.</li>
         <li>Amazon CloudFront's default behavior should be configured to not cache.</li>
         <li>Amazon CloudFront should have an additional behavior configured to cache an image for a default / minimum/ maximum  TTL = 30 minutes.</li>
         <li>Amazon CloudFront should have SSL enabled using the Default CloudFront Certificate.</li>
         <li>CodePipeline should be configured in such a way to deploy/update the files for the site.</li>
         <li>CodePipeline should trigger off any commits or pull request merged to a specific branch of the site's source code git repository.</li>
         <li>CodePipeline should invalidate the CloudFront Distribution after adding files to the site.</li>
